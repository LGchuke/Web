# Web

A collection of my web exercises, accumulation

顾名思义，这是一锅由 html、css、js 构成的乱七八糟的 code soup

demo, draft, frame, goods, utility, etc...

&nbsp;

**Content List**

* demos -- Different kinds of web demos
* draft -- Like a web playground, for single demo, no matter what it's name should be or which type it belongs
* frame -- Frames like Bootstrap, AmazeUI, etc... And it should be ignored
* goods -- Goods, and it should be ignored
* history -- History! Of course, it should be ignored
*   lib -- Libs like jquery.js, Three.js, react.min.js, etc... And it should be ignored
*   res -- Resource like background imgs, some color, etc... It should be rebuilt
*   svg -- SVG demos!
* tucao -- Don't care about this one😝
* utility -- I was, was wandering to write some utilities...
